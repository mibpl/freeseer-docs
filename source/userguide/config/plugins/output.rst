RTMP streaming
--------------

RTMP is a popular format for audio/video streaming.

With this plugin, you can easily stream to an arbitrary server.

To enable streaming, check the “Record to Stream” box in the Recording tab and set stream format to “RTMP Streaming”.

Specify the stream URL in the plugin settings window. Please note, that all other outputs must be set to “leaky mode”. Go to Plugins > Output > Video Preview and use the leaky queue dropdown.

There is built-in support for streaming to justin.tv service. To enable it, change the Streaming Destination from “custom” to ‘justin.tv“. You have to input your Streaming Key. To get one, log in to your justin.tv account and go to http://www.justin.tv/broadcast/adv_other.

As an optional feature, the plugin can automatically set justin.tv channel properties (stream title and description). To enable it, check the “Set justin.tv channel properties” box and input your Consumer Key and Consumer Secret below.

To obtain a Consumer Key and Consumer Secret from Justin.tv, navigate to http://www.twitch.tv/developer/activate in your browser. You will need to provide login credentials for Justin.tv, and this will make your account a developer account (as of this moment, this does not have any adverse effects). In order to obtain the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret, you will have to create an application in Justin.tv. To do this, navigate to http://www.twitch.tv/oauth_clients/create. On this page you will be asked to provide a name for the application and a set of URLs - these can be chosen arbitrarily, they serve no purpose for RTMP streaming. After you press Save, you will be taken to a page where the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret will be shown - you can now provide these to FreeSeer.

After you’re done with setting up your justin.tv preferences, click the “Apply - stream to justin.tv” button on the bottom of the settings tab.
